# RBL module

The RBL module provides support for checking the IPv4/IPv6 source address of a message's sender against a set of RBLs as well as various less conventional methods of using RBLs: against addresses in Received headers; against the reverse DNS name of the sender and against the parameter used for HELO/EHLO at SMTP time.

Configuration is structured as follows:

~~~ucl
# local.d/rbl.conf
# default settings defined here
rbls {
# 'rbls' subsection under which the RBL definitions are nested
	an_rbl {
			# rbl-specific subsection 
	}
	# ...
}
~~~

The default settings define the ways in which the RBLs are used unless overridden in an RBL-specific subsection.

Defaults may be set for the following parameters (default values used if these are not set are shown in brackets - note that these may be redefined in the default config):

- `default_ipv4`: use this RBL to test IPv4 addresses (`true` by default).
- `default_ipv6`: use this RBL to test IPv6 addresses (`false` by default).
- `default_received`: use this RBL to test IPv4/IPv6 addresses found in `Received` headers. The RBL should also be configured to check one/both of IPv4/IPv6 addresses (`true` by default).
- `default_from`: use this RBL to test IPv4/IPv6 addresses of message senders. The RBL should also be configured to check one/both of IPv4/IPv6 addresses (`false` by default).
- `default_rdns`: use this RBL to test reverse DNS names of message senders (hostnames passed to Rspamd should have been validated with a forward lookup, particularly if this is to be used to provide whitelisting) (`false` by default).
- `default_helo`: use this RBL to test parameters sent for HELO/EHLO at SMTP time (`false` by default).
- `default_dkim`: use this RBL to test domains found in validated DKIM signatures (`false` by default).
- `default_dkim_domainonly`: if `true` test top-level domain only, otherwise test entire domain found in DKIM signature (`true` by default).
- `default_emails`: use this RBL to test email addresses (found in message body) in form `[localpart].[domainpart].[rbl]` or if set to `"domain_only"` uses `[domainpart].[rbl]` (`false` by default).
- `default_unknown`: if set to `false`, do not yield a result unless the response received from the RBL is defined in its related returncodes `{}` subsection, else return the default symbol for the RBL (`false` by default).
- `default_exclude_users`: if set to `true`, do not use this RBL if the message sender is authenticated. (`false` by default).
- `default_exclude_private_ips`: if `true`, do not use the RBL if the sending host address is in `local_addrs` and do not check received headers baring these addresses (`true` by default).
- `default_exclude_local`: if `true`, hosts listed in `local_exclude_ip_map` should not be checked in this RBL (see also `local_exclude_ip_map` setting) (`true` by default).
- `default_is_whitelist`: if `true` matches on this list should neutralise any listings where this setting is false and ignore_whitelists is not true (`false` by default).
- `default_ignore_whitelists`: if `true` this list should not be neutralised by whitelists (`false` by default).

Other parameters which can be set here are:

- `local_exclude_ip_map`: map containing IPv4/IPv6 addresses/subnets that shouldn't be checked in RBLs (where `exclude_local` is `true` (default)).
- `hash`: (new in Rspamd 1.5) valid for `helo` and `emails` RBL types - lookup hashes instead of literal strings. Possible values for this parameter are `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512` and `md5` or any other value for the default hashing algorithm.
- `disable_monitoring`: (new in Rspamd 1.6) boolean value that disables monitoring completely. It should be placed in the **global [options]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/options.html)** file. 
- `monitored_address`: (new in Rspamd 1.6) fixed address to check for absence (`1.0.0.127` by default).

RBL-specific subsection is structured as follows:

~~~ucl
# Descriptive name of RBL or symbol if symbol is not defined.
an_rbl {
	# Explicitly defined symbol
	symbol = "SOME_SYMBOL";
	# RBL-specific defaults (where different from global defaults)
	#The global defaults may be overridden using 'helo' to override 'default_helo' and so on.
	ipv6 = true;
	ipv4 = false;
	# Address used for RBL-testing
	rbl = "v6bl.example.net";
	# Possible responses from RBL and symbols to yield
	returncodes {
		# Name_of_symbol = "address";
		EXAMPLE_ONE = "127.0.0.1";
		EXAMPLE_TWO = "127.0.0.2";
	}
}
~~~

The following extra settings are valid in the RBL subsection:

- `disabled`: if set, the RBL is not used. Use this to disable specific RBLs in `local.d/rbl.conf`. For example:

~~~ucl
rbls {
	spamhaus {
		disabled = true;
	}
}
~~~

- `whitelist_exception`: (for whitelists) - symbols named as parameters for this setting will not be used for neutralising blacklists (set this multiple times to add multiple exceptions).
